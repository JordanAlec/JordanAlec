## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

- 👷‍♂️ **Senior Software Developer** at **Zen Internet**
- 🧠 Believer in **simple solutions > clever solutions** (if your junior can't read it....)
- 🔒 Most of my meaningful work lives in **private repos** (sadly invisible, highly impactful - to me and some freelance bits)
- 🎹 Music nerd with an unhealthy addiction to all things Jazz
- 😵 Actively confused about AI: Morally questionable, enfringes on tons of copyright material and more, but I actively use it for brainstorming, boring things and explanations.

## 🔭 What I’m Currently Focused On

- Designing **maintainable .NET services** at scale  
- Building **modern web apps** with Next.js  
- Cloud-native architecture on **AWS**
- Containers, orchestration & reliability (**Docker / Kubernetes**)
- Improving developer experience and system observability
